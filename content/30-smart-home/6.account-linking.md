In this step you are going to setup **Account Linking** between your backend and Alexa. Account linking is required by Alexa when using Smart Home Skills in order to be able to identify the devices belonging to a given user.


When you deployed the Companion App, a Congito User Pool was created in the AWS account to store the user identities. Cognito provides a managed IdP that developers can use to manage their users identities and link them with Amazon accounts without writing one line of code. 

For more information about Amazon Cognito User Pool, please refer to the 
[developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html).

## What is Account Linking

{{% notice note %}}
If you already know what Account Linking is, you can skip to [Configure App Client OAuth 2.0 Settings]({{< relref "#configure-cognito-user-pool" >}})
{{% /notice %}}

In [Claim the device]({{< relref "#configure-app-client-oauth-2-0-settings" >}}) you have associated the Smart Lamp to the customer account in your backend. When the same customer interact with Alexa via the Alexa App or an Echo device, the Alexa backend will identify him/her with the Amazon identity. On order for the commands to be directed to the right devices, Alexa has to map the Amazon identity of the customer to the customer identity in your backend.


Account Linking in the Alexa Skills Kit uses [OAuth 2.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749). 
The following diagram explains the flow of obtain an **AccessToken** from your OAuth2.0 system.

![Auth-Code-Flow](/images/smart-home/auth-code-flow.png)

Alexa will send all the directives to you backend together with an **AccessToken**. The
backend should verify and decode the **AccessToken** to get user related information.

## Configure Cognito User Pool 

Alexa has to connect to Cognito User Pool to verify the user identity during the Account Linking, and the next steps will configure 
the Cognito User Pool with a new OAuth 2.0 client for Alexa. 

1. Go to [Cognito User Pool Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/users/?region=us-east-1#)

1. Select the user pool called `awsalexaui...`

1. In the left navigatiaon bar, under General Settings, select **App clients**

1. Click on **Add another app client** at the bottom of the list of clients

1. Enter a new **App client name** (eg `alexa`) and click on **Create app client**

1. On the left side navigation bar, under App integration, select **App client settings**

1. Find the App Client you just created. It should be named `alexa`

1. Under **Enabled Identity Providers**，select **Cognito User Pool**

1. In **Callback URL(s)**，enter **Redirect URLs** copied from Alexa Developer Console, separated by a comma. In Alexa Developer Console,
choose **Account Linking**, scroll down to the bottom, you should be able to find three **Redirect URL**. Alexa redirect 
to different url based on user's region. To serve all the Alexa users, it is suggested to copy all the URLs.

1. In **Allowed OAuth Flows** session，choose **Authorization code grant**

1. In **Allowed OAuth Scopes** session，choose **openid**

1. Click **Save changes**

## Configure Cognito User Pool domain name

In order for Alexa to be able to contact the User Pool you need to setup a public domain name. 
You can either use the default domain names available in Cognito which follow the pattern `https://<your-domain-prefix>.auth.<region>.amazoncognito.com`, 
or you can use your own domain name. To get more information please refer to 
[Adding a Custom Domain to a User Pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-add-custom-domain.html#cognito-user-pools-add-custom-domain-adding)。

For simplicity, let's configure the default domain name:

1. Go to Cognito User Pool Console

1. On the left side bar, under **App integration**, choose **Domain name**

1. Enter domain prefix and click **Check availability**, the domain name must be unique in the region

1. If the message **the domain is available** appear you can press **Save changes**

## Configure Account Linking in Alexa Developer Console

Now that we have setup the Cognito User Pool to allow an OAuth2.0 client to connect we can complete the Account Linking setup in the Alexa Developer console.

1. Go to [Alexa Console](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask)

1. In the **Skills** list，choose the previously created skill

1. On the left side navigation bar，choose **Account Linking**

1. Under **Security Provider Information**，choose **Auth Code Grant**

1. Enter `https://<your-cognito-domain>/oauth2/authorize` in **Authorization URI**

1. Enter `https://<your-cognito-domain>/oauth2/token` in **Access Token URI**

1. Enter **Client ID** and **Client Secret** (click **Show details** to display it) that you can find in Cognito User Pool console, under **App Clients** section
![](/images/smart-home/find-client-credentials.png)

1. Click **Add scope** and input `openid`. For Smart Home skill at least one scope should be specified which allows the retrieval of the user information.

1. Change **Authnetication scheme** to **Credentials in request body**

1. Click **Save** on the top right corner

[Amazon Cognito User Pools Auth API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-userpools-server-contract-reference.html)

## Perform Account Linking in Alexa App

{{% notice info %}}
A Skill in development is only accessible by the same account that has been used to develop it. Ensure that you are using the right credentials when logging in the app.
{{% /notice %}}

1. Launch Alexa APP on mobile phone

1. Click the button on the top left corner

1. Choose **Skills & Games**, then click **Your Skills**

1. Scroll the boxes left and click the **Dev**  

1. Your created Smart Home Skill **SmartLamp** should be listed below. Click it to continue.

1. Click the **Enable To Use** button

1. On the popup window, input your **email** and **password**, if have not registered yet, sign up one

1. Account Link success

{{% notice warning %}}
Do not try to Discover Devices now, it will not work! We have to create the Alexa Skill first which we will do next.
{{% /notice %}}

Smart Home Skills require Account Linking to be enabled. As explained previously the directives that are sent 
from Alexa to your skill will contain a JWT encoded **accessToken** in the message body. 
Your backend should verify the authenticity of the token and decode it to obtain
the user identity.
