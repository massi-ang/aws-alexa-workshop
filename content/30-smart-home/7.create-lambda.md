It is now time to create the backend for your skill, ie the service that will receive the Alexa directives 
corresponding to the user interactions with Alexa. 
In order to create a robust solution without having to setup and maintain a lot of infrastructure you are going to use [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). 



Make sure you've selected the **N.Virginia** region before you continue.


## Create Lambda Execution Role

1. Go to [IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam), choose **Roles** on the left side bar

1. click **Create Role**

1. Under Choose the service that will use this role, choose **Lambda**

1. Click **Next: Permissions**, **Next: Tags**, **Next: Review**

1. In the Review page, enter `alexa-lambda-role` for the **Role name**, and choose **Create role**

1. Click the `alexa-lambda-role`, under **Permissions** tab, click **Add inline policy**

1. In Create Policy page, select **JSON**, and copy & paste the following policy. Please remember to 
replace `<device-table-name>`. Check your DynamoDB table name in [DynamoDB 
Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/home?region=us-east-1#tables:).
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "dynamodb:Query"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:dynamodb:*:*:table/<device-table-name>/index/ByUsernameThingName"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "iot:UpdateThingShadow"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow"
        }
    ]
}
```

1. Click **Review Policy**

1. In the **Name** field, input a name for this policy

1. Click **Create Policy**

1. Click **Attach Policy**

1. Search for `LambdaBasic`. Select the checkbox on **AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole**

1. Click **Attach policy**

## Create the Lambda function

1. Go to [Lambda Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-east-1), click **Create function**

1. Select Author from scratch, and enter the following information:
    - Name: Provide a name for your Lambda function
    - Runtime: To use the sample code provided in this topic, choose **Node.js 10.x**
    - Role: under Perission, select **Use an existing role** and select the role [you previously created](#create-lambda-execution-role)
    ![](/images/smart-home/create-lambda-1.png)

1. Click **Create Function**. Your function should be created and you will move to **Configuration**

1. In the **Configuration** tab, expand the **Designer** section, and click on **Add triggers** 

1. Select the **Alexa Smart Home trigger**

1. In the **Configure triggers** section, add the **Skill ID** from the developer console in the box specified. 

1. Leave **Enable trigger** checked. This enables the Amazon Alexa service to call your Lambda 
function. 

1. Click **Add**

## Upload Code
1. Got to the Cloud9 instance and clone [this repo](https://github.com/massi-ang/alexa-iot-smarthome), 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/massi-ang/alexa-iot-smarthome
cd alexa-iot-smarthome
cd src
```

1. Edit `src/config.json` file. You find the necessary information in AWS Console and Alexa 
Console

1. Run `npm install --production` to install dependencies

1. Make a zip file to include `index.js`, `auth.js`, `config.json`, `alexa/` and `node_modules/`,
these files/directories should be located at the root level of the zip file
```
zip -r ../lambda.zip index.js auth.js config.json alexa/ node_modules/
```

1. Download the `lambda.zip` file to your laptop (right-click on the file name in the explorer pane) 

1. Go to [AWS Lambda Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda), click the lambda function

1. Under **Function code**, click **Upload** to upload the zip file

1. Click the **Save** button at the top right corner


## Configure Alexa Skill Endpoint

1. From the Lambda console, copy the **ARN** of the Lambda Function in the top right corner
