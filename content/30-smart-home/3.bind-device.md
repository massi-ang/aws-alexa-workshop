In this chapter, scan the QR Code generated from the virtual Smart Lamp simulator to create binding
relationship between device and user.

1. Use your Camera or Wechat Application to **scan** the QR Code that has been printed in the terminal window when you run the [lamp simulator]({{< ref "./2.smart-lamp-simulator.md" >}}). **NOTE**: From a laptop you can click on the URL link that is shown in the terminal under the QR Code

1. The browser will be redirected to a login page. The first time you'll need to create an account. 
Use a valid email address for both username and email since you'll receive a confirmation code.

1. Sign In and you should be redirected to the **Device Binding** page

1. Click the **Claim** button   
![](/images/smart-home/ui-device-bind.png?width=300)

1. Refresh the page to check if the button's status has changed to **Unclaim**

1. Go to [DynamoDB Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/home?region=us-east-1#tables:) to check the item in 
table named **Device-xxxxxxx**. *thingName* is the name of thing you created, and the *username* is the username field
in Cognito User Pool.

{{% notice tip %}}
This is just one way to create relationship between devices and users.
Alternatively you can store user information as an Attribute on the Thing, and leverage [Fleet Indexing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-indexing.html) to quickly retrieve the devices belonging to a given user.
