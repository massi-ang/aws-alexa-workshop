## What is a RTOS?

When programming microcontrollers there are mainly 2 paradigms:

* the super-loop
* real-time operating system

### Super-loop

In the super-loop model, think Arduino, the program consist in an infinite loop that executes each step in a given sequence, evaluates the different branches in sequence, etc. Complex logix become easily
unmanegeable in this model and it is not easy to prioritize certain operations compared to other.

### RTOS

An [RTOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_operating_system) doesn't normally provides all the features or OSes like Linux or Windows. At is core an RTOS provides a mechanism to schedule tasks to be executed on the MCU in order to achieve a time bound execution time. 
Each task is assigned a priority and tasks with higher priority might be able to pre-empt tasks with lower prio. 


## FreeRTOS

FreeRTOS is an Open Source Real Time operating system with support for over 30 embedded system architectures, such as MIPS, ARM7, ARM Cortex-M3, Xtensa.

The OS itself has a small footprint of between 4K to 9Kbytes, is written in C and is highly portable.

It provides different schedulers to control the execution of the task and a broad range of [inter-task communication](https://www.freertos.org/Inter-Task-Communication.html) mechanisms.

It also includes a [low power mode](https://www.freertos.org/low-power-tickless-rtos.html) for embedded application that have to run on battery.

You can find a summary of the FreeRTOS kernel fundamentals [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/dev-guide-freertos-kernel.html).

## Amazon FreeRTOS

Amazon FreeRTOS is open source and it extends the FreeRTOS kernel, the most popular real-time operating system for microcontrollers. With Amazon FreeRTOS, you can take advantage of the large ecosystem of existing tools developed for the FreeRTOS kernel. If you are already using the FreeRTOS kernel on your existing devices, you can choose to use Amazon FreeRTOS and take advantage of the functionality provided by the additional libraries, or continue to use just the kernel operating system.

Amazon FreeRTOS includes software libraries that make it easy to program commonly needed IoT capabilities into your device, including libraries that help configure devices to a local network using common connectivity options like Wi-Fi or Ethernet, or connect to a mobile device using Bluetooth Low Energy. Amazon FreeRTOS also includes an over-the-air (OTA) update feature to remotely update devices with feature enhancements or security patches.
