### Getting started

If you want to experiment with Amazon FreeRTOS on your own, please head to the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/freertos-getting-started.html).

For this lab, we are going to use a pre-configured example, since we also need the code to interact with the peripherals on the daughter board.

In this lab we are going to follow the instructions for the following project [https://github.com/EponaLab/afr-alexa-smarthome](https://github.com/EponaLab/afr-alexa-smarthome).

Click on the link and follow the instructions. Stop at the step when you are asked to checkout the `shadow-demo` branch.
