Now that you know the basics on how to create Alexa Smart Home skills, and how to control simulated devices, let's control a real device. 

In this lab you will:

* Compile and install a microcontroller firmware based on [Amazon FreeRTOS](https://aws.amazon.com/freertos/)
* Modify the firmware so that the ESP32 can respond to Alexa directives
