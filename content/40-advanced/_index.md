Now that you know the basics on how to create Alexa Smart Home skills, and how to use AWS IoT to control the devices,
let's look at a more advance implementation.
We will reuse the same Alexa Skill you have created in the [previous lab](/30-smart-home/4.create-skill/) but we will plug-in a new backend.

In this lab you will:

* Deploy a new generic Alexa Smart Home backend
* Implement a new Companion App that uses the new backend
* Reconfigure the existing device to use the new backend
