Welcome to AWS & Alexa Workshop!


[Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/) is Amazonâ€™s cloud-based voice service available on tens of millions of devices from Amazon and third-party device manufacturers. With Alexa, you can build natural voice experiences that  offer customers a more intuitive way to interact with the technology they use every day. Our collection of tools, APIs, reference solutions, and documentation make it easy for anyone to build with Alexa.

The intent of this workshop is to show users how to develop Alexa Smart Home Skills leveraging AWS services and in particular AWS IoT services to speed up the development.
